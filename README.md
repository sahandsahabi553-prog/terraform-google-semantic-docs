# Data Analysis Toolkit

A personal collection of scripts and utilities I use for processing datasets, running analyses, and tracking metrics across different projects.

## What's in here

Most of this grew out of repetitive tasks I kept doing manually — reading CSVs, transforming data, writing reports. Eventually it made sense to consolidate everything into one place.

- `analysis_result.json` — output from the latest run
- `docs/` — notes and documentation for each module
- `packages/` — reusable Python utilities
- `schemas/` — data validation schemas
- `sites/` — static content and feeds

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Notes

This is a working repo, not a polished library. Things change as I figure out better approaches. If something looks unfinished, it probably is.
